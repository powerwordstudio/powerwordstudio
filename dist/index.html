During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest.

                    <h2>Sharing</h2>
                    <p>We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
                    <p><i>And/or:</i>&nbsp;<br> <br> We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

                    <p><b>Security</b>&nbsp;<br> <br> We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>
                    <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>
                    <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

                    <p><b>Cookies</b>&nbsp;<br> <br> We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site.
